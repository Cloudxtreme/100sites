You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

The browser will remove extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed. Any number of lines count as one line, and any number of spaces count as one space.

The HTML <div> element is a block level element that can be used as a container for grouping other HTML elements.

 The <div> element has no special meaning. Except that, because it is a block level element, the browser will display a line break before and after it.

 When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to set style attributes to large blocks of content.
