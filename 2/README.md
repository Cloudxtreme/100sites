* In HTML there are semantic elements that replace div elements such as header nav article and footer.  Though you still use div for many uses.  
* If there isn't a semantic tag then use a divi, such as for a wrapper.
* listing of Semantic Elements can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* specify which margin to use: `margin: top right bottom left`
* to center the wrapper division: `margin: 0px auto`
* `clear:both` resets the float for the footer
